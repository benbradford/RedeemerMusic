Lo! He comes with clouds descending,
once for favoured sinners slain;
thousand thousand saints attending
hail the King who comes again.
Hallelujah!
Hallelujah!
Hallelujah!
God appears, on earth to reign.

Every eye shall now behold him,
robed in awesome majesty;
those who mocked, despised and sold him,
pierced and nailed him to the tree,
deeply mourning,
deeply mourning,
deeply mourning,
shall the true Messiah see.

Those deep wounds of cross and passion
still his dazzling body bears,
cause of endless exultation
to his ransomed worshippers:
with what wonder,
with what wonder,
with what wonder,
we shall see those glorious scars!

Now redemption, long expected,
see with solemn joy appear:
saints, whose faith this world rejected,
meet their Saviour in the air.
Hallelujah!
Hallelujah!
Hallelujah!
See the day of God appear.

Yes, Amen! let all adore you
high on your eternal throne!
Saviour, take the power and glory,
claim the kingdom for your own.
Come, Lord Jesus!
Come, Lord Jesus!
Come, Lord Jesus!
Everlasting God, come down
