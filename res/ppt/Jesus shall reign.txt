Jesus shall reign wherever the sun
Does its successive journeys run
His kingdom stretch from shore to shore
Till sun shall rise and set no more

Blessings abound wherever He reigns
The prisoner leaps to lose his chains
The weary find eternal rest
And all the sons of want are blessed

To our King be highest praise
Rising through eternal days
Just and faithful He shall reign
Jesus shall reign

People and realms of every tongue
Dwell on His love with sweetest song
And infant voices shall proclaim
Their early blessings on His name

To our King be highest praise
Rising through eternal days
Just and faithful He shall reign
Jesus shall reign

Let every creature rise and bring
Blessing and honour to our King
Angels descend with songs again
And earth repeat the loud amen

To our King be highest praise
Rising through eternal days
Just and faithful He shall reign
Jesus shall reign
