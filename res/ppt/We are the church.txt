Before the world began
God made a masterplan
To bring all things together
Under one head
That head is Jesus Christ
Who died and rose to life
And now he’s seated
At the right hand of God

Once we were dead in sin
Now we are raised with him
By grace we’re saved, through faith
In Jesus alone
Part of his body now
United by his power
Joined with his people
A-all over the world

We are the church, have you heard?
He washed us clean with his word
He chose us to be on his team
We are more loved than we could dream
We’ve got good news, shout it out
You’ve got to hear what it’s all about
No-one’s too far away to be
Welcomed into God’s family

Speaking the truth in love
To build the body up
We serve each other
Using gifts from the King
We pray for unity
So everyone will see
God’s plan in action
In his people today

We are the church, have you heard?
He washed us clean with his word
He chose us to be on his team
We are more loved than we could dream
We’ve got good news, shout it out
You’ve got to hear what it’s all about
No-one’s too far away to be
Welcomed into God’s family

One Lord, one faith
One God, one Father
One body, one Spirit
We are one in Christ
One hope, one truth
One cross, one Saviour
One mission, one future
We are one in Christ

One Lord, one faith
One God, one Father
One body, one Spirit
We are one in Christ
One hope, one truth
One cross, one Saviour
One mission, one future
We are one in Christ

We are the church, have you heard?
He washed us clean with his word
He chose us to be on his team
We are more loved than we could dream
We’ve got good news, shout it out
You’ve got to hear what it’s all about
No-one’s too far away to be
Welcomed into God’s family
