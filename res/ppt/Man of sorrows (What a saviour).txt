Man of Sorrows what a name
For the Son of God who came
Ruined sinners to reclaim hallelujah
Bearing shame and scoffing rude
In my place condemned He stood
Sealed my pardon with His blood
Hallelujah hallelujah

Saviour You showed Your love
Defeated our sin poured out Your blood
So we praise You Lamb that was slain
We offer our lives to proclaim
What a Saviour

Guilty vile and helpless we
Spotless Lamb of God was He
Full atonement can it be hallelujah
Lifted up was He to die
It is finished was His cry
Now in heaven exalted high
Hallelujah hallelujah

Saviour You showed Your love
Defeated our sin poured out Your blood
So we praise You Lamb that was slain
We offer our lives to proclaim
What a Saviour

When He comes our glorious King
All His ransomed home to bring
Then anew this song we'll sing
Hallelujah hallelujah

Saviour You showed Your love
Defeated our sin poured out Your blood
So we praise You Lamb that was slain
We offer our lives to proclaim
What a Saviour
