Who O Lord could save themselves
Their own soul could heal
Our shame was deeper than the sea
Your grace is deeper still

You alone can rescue
You alone can save
You alone can lift us from the grave
You came down to find us led us out of death
To You alone belongs the highest praise

You O Lord have made a way
The great divide You healed
For when our hearts were far away
Your love went further still
Yes Your love goes further still

You alone can rescue
You alone can save
You alone can lift us from the grave
You came down to find us led us out of death
To You alone belongs the highest praise

We lift up our eyes lift up our eyes
You're the giver of life
We lift up our eyes lift up our eyes
You're the giver of life
(x2)

You alone can rescue
You alone can save
You alone can lift us from the grave
You came down to find us led us out of death
To You alone belongs the highest praise
To You alone belongs the highest praise
To You alone belongs the highest praise
