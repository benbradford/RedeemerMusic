Your glorious cause O God
Engages our hearts
May Jesus Christ be known
Wherever we are
We ask not for ourselves
But for Your renown
The cross has saved us so we pray
Your kingdom come

Let Your kingdom come
Let Your will be done
So that everyone might know Your Name
Let Your song be heard everywhere on earth
Till Your sovereign work on earth is done
Let Your kingdom come

Give us Your strength O God
And courage to speak
Perform Your wondrous deeds
Through those who are weak
Lord use us as You want
Whatever the test
By grace we'll preach Your Gospel till
Our dying breath

Let Your kingdom come
Let Your will be done
So that everyone might know Your Name
Let Your song be heard everywhere on earth
Till Your sovereign work on earth is done

Let Your kingdom come
Let Your will be done
So that everyone might know Your Name
Let Your song be heard everywhere on earth
Till Your sovereign work on earth is done
Let Your kingdom come
