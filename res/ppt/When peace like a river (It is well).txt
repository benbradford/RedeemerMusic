When peace, like a river, attendeth my way
when sorrows like sea billows roll
whatever my lot, you have taught me to say
It is well, it is well with my soul
It is well with my soul
It is well, it is well with my soul

Though Satan should buffet, though trials should come
let this blest assurance control
that Christ has regarded my helpless estate
and has shed His own blood for my soul
It is well with my soul
It is well, it is well with my soul

My sin, O the bliss of this glorious thought
My sin, not in part but the whole
is nailed to the cross and I bear it no more
praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul
It is well with my soul
It is well, it is well with my soul

For me it is Christ, it is Christ now to live
Though deathâ€™s waters over me roll
no fear shall be mine, for in death as in life
you will whisper your peace to my soul
It is well with my soul
It is well, it is well with my soul

And, Lord, for your coming in glory we wait
the sky, not the grave, is our goal
the trumpet shall sound and the Lord shall descend
bless the Lord, bless the Lord, O my soul
It is well with my soul
It is well, it is well with my soul
