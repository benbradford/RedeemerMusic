Crown Him with many crowns
the Lamb upon His throne
while heavenâ€™s eternal anthem drowns
all music but its own!
Awake my soul and sing
of Him who died to be
Your Saviour and your matchless King
through all eternity

Crown him the Son of God
before the worlds began
let all who tread where he has trod
crown him the Son of man,
who every grief has known
by which we are oppressed,
and takes and bears them for his own
that all in him may rest.

Crown him the Lord of life,
triumphant from the grave,
who rose victorious from the strife
for those he came to save:
his glories now we sing
who died and rose on high;
who died eternal life to bring
and lives that death may die.

Crown him the Lord of love!
Behold his hands and side,
those wounds yet visible above
in beauty glorified!
No angel in the sky
can fully bear that sight,
but downward bends his burning eye
at mysteries so bright.

Crown him the Lord of peace,
let praise fill every land;
from pole to pole let warfare cease:
his kingdom is at hand!
For ever he shall reign,
and earthly princes fall
before his throne, the Lamb once slain,
the sovereign Lord of all.

Crown him the Lord of years,
the Sovereign Lord of time,
Creator of the rolling spheres,
in majesty sublime:
all hail, Redeemer, hail,
for you have died for me;
your praise shall never, never fail
through all eternity!
