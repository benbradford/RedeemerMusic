Our God is a great big God
Our God is a great big God
Our God is a great big God
And He holds us in His hands

He's higher than a skyscraper
And He's deeper than a submarine
He's wider than the universe
And beyond my wildest dreams

And He's known me and He's loved me
Since before the world began
How wonderful to be a part of
God's amazing plan

Our God is a great big God
Our God is a great big God
Our God is a great big God
And He holds us in His hands

He's higher than a skyscraper
And He's deeper than a submarine
He's wider than the universe
And beyond my wildest dreams

And He's known me and He's loved me
Since before the world began
How wonderful to be a part of
God's amazing plan

Our God is a great big God
Our God is a great big God
Our God is a great big God
And He holds us in His hands

Our God is a great big God
Our God is a great big God
Our God is a great big God
And He holds us in His hands
