You know everything about me
You know when I wake and sleep
You know everything I'm thinking
You know all my secret deeds
You know every word I say
Long before I say it
You know everywhere I go
And all my ways

You are always with me Jesus
Where could I go
Where could I hide
You are always with me Jesus
Where could I go
You never leave my side

If I flew away to heaven
Jesus there I would find You
If I sank into the ocean
Jesus You would be there too
Even in the darkest night
To You it's bright as day
You have laid Your hand on me
It's wonderful

You are always with me Jesus
Where could I go
Where could I hide
You are always with me Jesus
Where could I go
You never leave my side
