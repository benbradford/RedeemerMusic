O great God of highest heaven
Occupy my lowly heart
Own it all and reign supreme
Conquer every rebel power

Let no vice or sin remain
That resists Your holy war
You have loved and purchased me
Make me Yours forever more

I was blinded by my sin
Had no ears to hear Your voice
Did not know Your love within
Had no taste for heaven's joys

Then Your Spirit gave me life
Opened up Your word to me
Through the gospel of Your Son
Gave me endless hope and peace

Help me now to live a life
That's dependent on Your grace
Keep my heart and guard my soul
From the evils that I face

You are worthy to be praised
With my every thought and deed
O great God of highest heaven
Glorify Your Name through me

You are worthy to be praised
With my every thought and deed
O great God of highest heaven
Glorify Your Name through me
