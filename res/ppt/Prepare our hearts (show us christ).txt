Prepare our hearts O God
Help us to receive
Break the hard and stony ground
Help our unbelief
Plant Your Word down deep in us
'Cause it to bear fruit
Open up our ears to hear
Lead us in Your truth

Show us Christ
Show us Christ
O God reveal Your glory
Through the preaching of Your Word
Until every heart confesses
Christ is Lord

Your Word is living light
Upon our darkened eyes
Guards us through temptations
Makes the simple wise
Your Word is food for famished ones
Freedom for the slave
Riches for the needy soul
Come speak to us today

Show us Christ
Show us Christ
O God reveal Your glory
Through the preaching of Your Word
Until every heart confesses
Christ is Lord
