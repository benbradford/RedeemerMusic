Praise my soul, the King of Heaven,
to his feet your tribute bring;
ransomed, healed, restored, forgiven,
who like me his praise should sing?
Praise him! Praise him!
Praise him! Praise him!
Praise the everlasting King.

Praise him for his grace and favour
to his people in distress;
praise him, still the same for ever,
slow to anger, swift to bless.
Praise him! Praise him!
Praise him! Praise him!
glorious in his faithfulness.

Father-like he tends and spares us,
well our feeble frame he knows;
in his hands he gently bears us,
rescues us from all our foes.
Praise him! Praise him!
Praise him! Praise him!
widely as his mercy flows.

Frail as summerâ€™s flower we flourish;
blows the wind and it is gone;
but while mortals rise and perish
God endures unchanging on.
Praise him! Praise him!
Praise him! Praise him!
Praise the high eternal One.

Angels in the heights adore him;
they behold him face to face;
sun and moon, bow down before him,
all who dwell in time and space.
Praise him! Praise him!
Praise him! Praise him!
Praise with us the God of grace.
