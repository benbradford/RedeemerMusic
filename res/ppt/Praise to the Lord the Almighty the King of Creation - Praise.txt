Praise to the Lord
the almighty the king of creation
O my soul praise him for
he is your health and salvation
Come all who hear
brothers and sisters draw near
praise him in glad adoration

Praise to the Lord
above all things so mightily reigning
keeping us safe at his side
and so gently sustaining
Have you not seen
all you have needed has been
met by his gracious ordaining

Praise to the Lord
who shall prosper our work and defend us
surely his goodness and mercy
shall daily attend us
Ponder anew
what the Almighty can do
who with his love will befriend us

Praise to the Lord
who when darkness and sin are abounding
who when the godless are rampant
all goodness confounding
breaks forth as light
scatters the terrors of night
saints with his mercy surrounding

Praise to the Lord
O let all that is in me adore him
All that has life and breath
come now with praises before him
Let the ‘Amen!’
sound from his people again
gladly we praise and adore him!
