      "O great God of highest heaven\nOccupy my lowly heart\nOwn it all and reign supreme\nConquer every rebel power\nLet no vice or sin remain\nThat resists Your holy war\nYou have loved and purchased me\nMake me Yours forever more",
      "I was blinded by my sin\nHad no ears to hear Your voice\nDid not know Your love within\nHad no taste for heaven's joys\nThen Your Spirit gave me life\nOpened up Your word to me\nThrough the gospel of Your Son\nGave me endless hope and peace",
      "Help me now to live a life\nThat's dependent on Your grace\nKeep my heart and guard my soul\nFrom the evils that I face\nYou are worthy to be praised\nWith my every thought and deed\nO great God of highest heaven\nGlorify Your Name through me",
