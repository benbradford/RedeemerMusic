There is a Redeemer
Jesus God's own Son
Precious Lamb of God Messiah
Holy One

Jesus my Redeemer
Name above all names
Precious Lamb of God Messiah
O for sinners slain

Thank You O my Father
For giving us Your Son
And leaving Your Spirit
Till the work on earth is done

When I stand in glory
I will see His face
There I'll serve my King forever
In that holy place

Thank You O my Father
For giving us Your Son
And leaving Your Spirit
Till the work on earth is done
