To Him be the glory for all He has done
Praise to the Father who gave us His Son
A ransom for many, He bled and died
Then rose in victory, enthroned on high

To Him be the glory in heaven and earth
All of creation is shouting His worth
The saints and the angels all live to proclaim
The wonderful story, the glorious Name

Oh look and see our God and celebrate
The power of the cross and the empty grave
And now we're free, let the redeemed lift up your heads
Oh look and see our God

To Him be the glory, He's coming again
And all of the sadness will come to an end
Oh what a reunion, the bride and her King
Forever we'll praise Him, forever we'll sing

Oh look and see our God and celebrate
The power of the cross and the empty grave
And now we're free, let the redeemed lift up your heads
Oh look and see our God

Glory, glory, to our God
Glory, glory, to our God
Glory, glory ,to our God
Glory, glory, to our God

Oh look and see our God and celebrate
The power of the cross and the empty grave
And now we're free, let the redeemed lift up your heads
Oh look and see our God
