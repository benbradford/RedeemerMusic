O come, O come, Emmanuel
And ransom captive Israel
That mourns in lonely exile here
Until the Son of God appears

O come, Thou, Dayspring from on high
And cause Thy light on us to rise
Disperse the gloomy clouds of night
And death's dark shadow put to flight

Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel
Shall come to thee, O Israel!

O come, O come, true prophet of the Lord
And turn the key to heaven’s door
Be Thou our comforter and guide
And lead us to the Father’s side

Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel
Shall by His Word our darkness dispel

O come, our great High Priest, and intercede
Thy sacrifice, our only plea
The judgment we no longer fear
Thy precious blood has brought us near

Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel
Has banished every fear of hell

O Come, Thou King of nations, bring
An end to all our suffering
Bid every pain and sorrow cease
And reign now as our Prince of Peace

Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel
Shall come again with us to dwell
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel
Shall come again with us to dwell
